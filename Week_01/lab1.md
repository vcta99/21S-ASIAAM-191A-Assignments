1. I used the "Total Population" and "White Population" fields to determine what percentage of a given county was white. I called this field "White Overrepresented". Using the county stats, I determined that white folk make up 59.7% of California's total population. I filtered my "White Overrepresented" column to only show counties where white populations made up over 59.7% of the county's total population.

2. I used those field because I wanted to better unederstand which counties were homogenously white. I thought that using a percentage ratio rather than a total, and comparing that ratio against the state average, would give me better insight on how the county compares to the state.

3. The data set does not includ Latin American as a racial category. Because the data set doesn not account for non-white hispanics, I think that the white population may be overrepresented.
