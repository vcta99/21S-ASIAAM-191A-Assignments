## Lab Assignment #4 - Loops and APIs
### Due 5/6

In this week's lab, we learned how to loop through data and connect to an API. Your task is to create a mini-version of the final group project for the class that intakes data and maps it.

The requirements are:

- Use any type of [for-loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) within a [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) that adds API data from a Google Spreadsheet form.
- Add a pop-up with at least 2 fields from the Google Form.
- Add data from Google Spreadsheets into your map
